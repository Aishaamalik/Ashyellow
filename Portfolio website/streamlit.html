                <p class="projects-intro">
                    Welcome to my Streamlit projects portfolio! I specialize in building interactive and data-driven applications using Streamlit, an open-source framework for creating beautiful web apps with Python. My projects range from data analysis dashboards to predictive modeling applications, offering insightful visualizations and interactive features. Each project showcases my ability to integrate machine learning models, data preprocessing, and real-time data updates into user-friendly interfaces. Whether it's analyzing climate data, detecting fraud in insurance claims, or exploring freelance work patterns, my Streamlit projects are designed to help users make informed decisions through data visualization and analysis. Take a look at my work and experience the power of interactive dashboards!                </p>
