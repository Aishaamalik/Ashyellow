                <p class="projects-intro">
                    Below are a selection of my data analysis projects, each tackling real-world business and research challenges. These projects demonstrate my expertise in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, predictive modeling, and dashboard development. I use technologies such as Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM), SQL, Tableau, and machine learning frameworks to deliver actionable insights and robust solutions.

                        <h3>Mental Health in Tech Industry</h3>
                        <p>This project analyzes mental health attitudes, family history, and treatment patterns in the tech industry, revealing moderate openness about mental health discussions but significant barriers, particularly with supervisors. It highlights the impact of mental health on work productivity, with nearly half of employees experiencing work interference. Predictive modeling offers insights into factors influencing help-seeking but faces challenges due to weak correlations. The report recommends fostering a stigma-free workplace culture, improving mental health leave policies, and expanding support resources to enhance employee well-being.</p>

                        <h3>Freelance Earnings & Job trends</h3>
                        <p>In this project, I analyzed freelance market trends, focusing on earnings patterns, skill demand, and platform performance. I cleaned and visualized data to uncover insights, revealing that high job volume doesn't always correlate with higher earnings. I built predictive models using machine learning algorithms to forecast freelancer earnings based on job attributes. The findings led to actionable recommendations for freelancers, clients, and platform owners, emphasizing the importance of reputation, specialization, and job distribution for success in the freelance ecosystem</p>

                        <h3>Pridicting Product Return Probability in E-commerce</h3>
                        <p>This project focused on predicting e-commerce product returns by analyzing various factors, such as product price, order quantity, and customer demographics. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), I identified key patterns, including higher return rates for electronics, clothing, and larger discounts. I then built and evaluated several machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict the likelihood of a product being returned. The insights led to recommendations like monitoring high-return categories, personalizing return policies, and flagging high-risk orders for review, ultimately helping businesses reduce return rates and optimize their operations.</p>

                        <h3>Insurance Claim Fraud Detection</h3>
                        <p>This project focused on detecting fraudulent insurance claims using machine learning techniques. I approached the problem by applying supervised classification, with the target variable being whether a claim was fraudulent or not. After preprocessing the data, I evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Isolation Forest. The LightGBM model emerged as the best performer, achieving 75% accuracy and a 0.82 ROC-AUC score, along with a 40% recall for fraud cases. The challenges of class imbalance were addressed through techniques like stratified sampling and probability thresholding. The model can significantly aid insurance companies in detecting fraudulent claims early, reducing financial losses and operational inefficiencies. Future improvements include adding more features and exploring advanced anomaly detection techniques.</p>

                        <h3>Climate Change Pridiction</h3>
                        <p>This project focused on analyzing climate change data to identify global trends, influencing factors, and build predictive models for temperature and emissions. The dataset, which includes country-specific climate indicators like temperature, CO₂ levels, and emissions, was thoroughly explored through visual tools such as histograms and correlation matrices. Data cleaning involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers, followed by feature engineering to create time-based and aggregated features. Multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were tested and evaluated based on metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score. The top-performing models highlighted key drivers of climate change, providing valuable insights for predicting future environmental trends.</p>

                            The Mental Health & Economic Indicators Analysis Project aims to explore the relationship between economic factors and mental health, predicting the likelihood of mental health treatment and providing actionable insights. Using the Mental Health in Tech Survey Dataset, I performed data cleaning, addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I visualized trends using univariate and bivariate plots, and conducted correlation analysis. I evaluated models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM, with Random Forest yielding the best results in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Key insights revealed that economic stress and employer support play significant roles in mental health. Future work includes expanding the dataset and creating a live dashboard for real-time analysis. The project provides valuable insights for policymakers and health professionals.</p>
